The secret is out.

</li><li>
For decades, your organization
stayed in the shadows,

</li><li>
Hiding the truth.

</li><li>
But now we know...
they're among us.

</li><li>
Heroes...

</li><li>
And monsters.

</li><li>
The world is full of wonders.

</li><li>
Thanks, Bernie.
You bet.

</li><li>
Ace,
come and get it.

</li><li>
What do you say we go out to
your Aunt Mindy's this weekend?

</li><li>
You and Kisha
can swim in the pond.

</li><li>
Sure.

</li><li>
You know, you got a birthday
coming up in a couple of months.

</li><li>
Who's your favorite?

</li><li>
I'm okay.

</li><li>
Hey.

</li><li>
Things are tight right now,
but I'm gonna find something.

</li><li>
Not back at the factory,
but I got prospects.

</li><li>
You and me...
what are we?

</li><li>
We're a team.
That's right.

</li><li>
So, who do you...

</li><li>
Are you okay?
All right, Ace, look at me.

</li><li>
I need you to stay here
with Bernie, okay?

</li><li>
People might be hurt, and I'm
gonna see if they need my help.

</li><li>
Stay with Bernie.

</li><li>
Watch my boy!

</li><li>
Help me!

</li><li>
Help me!!

</li><li>
Come on!

</li><li>
Come on!

</li><li>
Come on! Get out! Get out!
Come on!

</li><li>
Anybody in the building still?!

</li><li>
Aah!

</li><li>
Help me! Help me!

</li><li>
Keep going.

</li><li>
We can't explain
everything we see.

</li><li>
But our eyes are open.

</li><li>
So what now?

</li><li>
There are no more shadows
for you to hide in.

</li><li>
Something impossible
just happened.

</li><li>
What are you going to do
about it?

</li><li>
Agent Ward,
there's been a development.

</li><li>
It's the Rising Tide.

</li><li>
They've pinned down
the location of the package.

</li><li>
We need to abort.

</li><li>
I'm five minutes away
from retrieving it.

</li><li>
So is everyone else.

</li><li>
They posted the coordinates online.

</li><li>
If the job was easy...
Yeah, it wouldn't be any fun.

</li><li>
Watch your six.

</li><li>
Red tie, by the window.

</li><li>
Your fireplace is broken.

</li><li>
Ward, just a heads-up.

</li><li>
We've got possible hostiles
in your vicinity.

</li><li>
Really?

</li><li>
What does "S.H.I.E.L.D."
stand for, agent Ward?

</li><li>
Strategic Homeland
Intervention, Enforcement

</li><li>
and Logistics Division.

</li><li>
And what does that mean
to you?

</li><li>
It means someone
really wanted our initials

</li><li>
to spell out "SHIELD."

</li><li>
It means we're the line...

</li><li>
Between the world
and the much weirder world.

</li><li>
We protect people from news
they aren't ready to hear.

</li><li>
And when we can't do that,
we keep them safe.

</li><li>
Something turns up...

</li><li>
like this
Chitauri neural link...

</li><li>
we get to it
before someone bad does.

</li><li>
Any idea who Vanchat
was planning to sell it to?

</li><li>
I'm more interested
in how this Rising Tide group

</li><li>
found out about it.

</li><li>
I thought
they were just hackers.

</li><li>
What changed?

</li><li>
Everything's changing.

</li><li>
A little while ago,
most people went to bed

</li><li>
thinking that the
craziest thing in the world

</li><li>
was a billionaire
in a flying metal suit.

</li><li>
Then aliens invaded New York
and were beaten back

</li><li>
By, among others,
a giant green monster,

</li><li>
a costumed hero from the '40s,
and a god.

</li><li>
I don't think
Thor's technically a god.

</li><li>
Well, you haven't
been near his arms.

</li><li>
The battle of New York
was the end of the world.

</li><li>
This... now...
is the new world.

</li><li>
People are different.

</li><li>
They have access to tech,
to formulas,

</li><li>
Secrets
they're not ready for.

</li><li>
Why was I
pulled out of Paris?

</li><li>
That, you'll have to ask
agent Coulson.

</li><li>
Uh, yeah.
I'm clearance level six.

</li><li>
I know that... Agent Coulson
was killed in action

</li><li>
Before
the battle of New York.

</li><li>
Got the full report.

</li><li>
Welcome to level seven.

</li><li>
Sorry...
that corner was really dark,

</li><li>
and I couldn't help myself.

</li><li>
I think there's a bulb out.

</li><li>
Director Fury
faked your death

</li><li>
to motivate the Avengers.

</li><li>
Well,
the death of a common ally

</li><li>
is a particularly effective
team builder.

</li><li>
Say "cheese."

</li><li>
Plus, it wasn't 
that much of a stretch.

</li><li>
I stopped breathing
for about 40 seconds.

</li><li>
Eight. It gets longer
every time you tell it.

</li><li>
Yeah, well, you get shanked
by the Asgardian Mussolini,

</li><li>
You can tell it
your way.

</li><li>
I was looking
at the big white light,

</li><li>
And it felt like a lot longer
than eight seconds.

</li><li>
Do they know?

</li><li>
The Avengers...
that Fury played them?

</li><li>
They're
not level seven.

</li><li>
I got out of the I.C.U.,

</li><li>
Fury stuck me
in a grass shack in Tahiti.

</li><li>
Rough gig.

</li><li>
Mai tais, Travis McGee novels,
and a physical therapist

</li><li>
whose command of english
was... irrelevant.

</li><li>
But something
put you back in the game.

</li><li>
What is that?

</li><li>
That's a superhero,
Agent Ward.

</li><li>
An unregistered gifted.
Identity... unknown.

</li><li>
The secret's out.

</li><li>
For decades,
your organization...

</li><li>
On May 2nd,
an unidentified object...

</li><li>
Another little present
from The Rising Tide.

</li><li>
How are they getting
this stuff before us?

</li><li>
Same way they cracked
our RSA implementation.

</li><li>
They're good.

</li><li>
So I need better.

</li><li>
Agent Coulson
has requisitioned

</li><li>
a mobile command unit,
to which you are assigned.

</li><li>
Rising Tide
is trying to draw us out.

</li><li>
I think it's time
they succeeded.

</li><li>
You want me
to cross them off?

</li><li>
Wow. No.

</li><li>
I want to use them
to get to him.

</li><li>
This man's world
is about to get very weird.

</li><li>
He's gonna need
some help.

</li><li>
I'm sorry.

</li><li>
I was trained from day one
as a specialist.

</li><li>
I go in alone.
I get it done.

</li><li>
Defusing a nuclear bomb...
I'm your guy.

</li><li>
A welcoming committee?

</li><li>
Not my speed.

</li><li>
I know
it's not what you want.

</li><li>
Agent Hill did a very
detailed assessment

</li><li>
of your last three missions.

</li><li>
Combat... top grades.

</li><li>
Espionage...

</li><li>
She gave you the highest marks
since Romanoff.

</li><li>
Under "people skills,"
she drew a...

</li><li>
I think
it's a little poop

</li><li>
with knives
sticking out of it.

</li><li>
What? 
It...

</li><li>
That's bad, right?

</li><li>
And given
your family history,

</li><li>
I'm surprised
it's not worse.

</li><li>
But...

</li><li>
I think you're the guy
for this.

</li><li>
We're meeting now.

</li><li>
If I'm wrong, you go
straight back to your bombs.

</li><li>
Team's approved.
Physicals are all fine.

</li><li>
Fitz-Simmons
is not cleared for combat.

</li><li>
I'm told
that won't be an issue.

</li><li>
Agent Ward here...
he's almost too fit.

</li><li>
That's an issue.
That should be an issue.

</li><li>
Maybe I can't join
the team

</li><li>
God, are you dismissed.
Because my...

</li><li>
It was a porcupine.
It was not a poop.

</li><li>
It just means that he...

</li><li>
No, I'm pretty sure.

</li><li>
And it's not just Ward.
Your whole roster is sketchy.

</li><li>
Well, they're cleared.

</li><li>
I would have been very happy
not to clear you, Phil.

</li><li>
I'd love for you
to rest up some more.

</li><li>
I've had plenty of that.
Thanks.

</li><li>
You sure?

</li><li>
You should go sometime.

</li><li>
Where?

</li><li>
Tahiti.

</li><li>
It's a magical place.

</li><li>
Three days in, I'd be begging
for an assignment.

</li><li>
Exactly.

</li><li>
Tahiti.

</li><li>
He really doesn't know,
does he?

</li><li>
He can never know.

</li><li>
I-is there any way
I can thank him?

</li><li>
Are you sure nobody saw him?

</li><li>
So,
the identity of the hooded hero

</li><li>
still remains unknown.

</li><li>
Researchers
at UCLA Medical Center

</li><li>
released a study today which
shows that supplemental...

</li><li>
Just act natural.

</li><li>
What?

</li><li>
Just pretend
that we're talking.

</li><li>
We are.

</li><li>
Good.

</li><li>
'Cause you never know
who's listening.

</li><li>
I don't even know
who's talking.

</li><li>
I'm Skye.

</li><li>
And you're
the hooded hero.

</li><li>
Please tell me that you're not
staying with that name.

</li><li>
Wait. What? I'm not...
I'm a factory worker.

</li><li>
Sure, by day.

</li><li>
I saw you.
You're a hero.

</li><li>
Like, a for-real superhero,
which is...

</li><li>
I'm not, like, a groupie,
stalker type, but...

</li><li>
Oh, my god!
That is so cool!

</li><li>
Okay, okay, chill.

</li><li>
Just don't...
don't draw attention.

</li><li>
You're in danger.

</li><li>
You got the wrong guy,
lady.

</li><li>
No, you've got
the wrong approach.

</li><li>
The cute girl from the hospital
is dying to thank you...

</li><li>
And possibly "thank" you...

</li><li>
And you're hiding.

</li><li>
The clip of you rescuing her
has had the most hits

</li><li>
Since that puppy
with vertigo,

</li><li>
And you can't even
find a job.

</li><li>
What do you mean
about danger?

</li><li>
S.H.I.E.L.D.

</li><li>
Shield, what?
I should carry a shield?

</li><li>
S.H.I.E.L.D.
Government.

</li><li>
Scary men in dark suits
who come after guys like you.

</li><li>
They knew about
the battle of New York

</li><li>
before it even happened

</li><li>
and then cleaned it up

</li><li>
before anyone could ask
any real questions... overnight.

</li><li>
How long do you think it'll take
for them to clean you up?

</li><li>
And you want to know
why I'm hiding.

</li><li>
What if you didn't hide?

</li><li>
What if you got
in front of this

</li><li>
and let people know
that you're a hero?

</li><li>
I'm just a guy.

</li><li>
Well, a guy like that
gets work, gets perks.

</li><li>
I can help.

</li><li>
I'm great with computers...
like, weirdly great.

</li><li>
I mean, I could help you create
a whole new identity or...

</li><li>
a mask.

</li><li>
O-kay.
Uh, ok...

</li><li>
well, you could just... also,
we could just stick with the...

</li><li>
hood.

</li><li>
Listen, you cannot
walk away from this.

</li><li>
With great power comes...

</li><li>
a ton of weird crap that you are
not prepared to deal with.

</li><li>
Now, my office is...

</li><li>
You have an office?

</li><li>
Yes, I have an office.

</li><li>
It's a mobile... office.

</li><li>
It's a... van.
I live in a van... by choice.

</li><li>
But it's always in the alley
around the corner...

</li><li>
Free wi-fi...
and you can come by anytime.

</li><li>
Thank you.

</li><li>
They're coming for you.

</li><li>
Mike.

</li><li>
Agent May.

</li><li>
No.

</li><li>
So you've been briefed.

</li><li>
I'm not going back
in the field.

</li><li>
Yeah.

</li><li>
You've got
such a nice setup here.

</li><li>
You ever thought
about adding a moat?

</li><li>
I just need you
to drive the bus,

</li><li>
Liaise ground transpo,
some on-site supervision.

</li><li>
This isn't a combat op.

</li><li>
Then you don't need me.

</li><li>
I do.

</li><li>
'Cause we'll be running
ourselves.

</li><li>
Picking the ops...

</li><li>
Making the calls.

</li><li>
No red tape.

</li><li>
This is where they actually
make the red tape, isn't it?

</li><li>
I always wondered.

</li><li>
Melinda.

</li><li>
You're really just asking me
to drive the bus?

</li><li>
I'm not asking.

</li><li>
But it's a really nice bus.

</li><li>
You need to know?

</li><li>
Yeah. ASAP, please.

</li><li>
- That's gonna be on a secondary.
- Yeah, got it!

</li><li>
Whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, whoa! Watch it!

</li><li>
That's
the night-night gun.

</li><li>
Well, it's on
my stuff, and it doesn't work,

</li><li>
And there's no way we're calling
it the night-night gun.

</li><li>
The bullets work.

</li><li>
Nonlethal,
heavy stopping power,

</li><li>
Break up under
the subcutaneous tissue...

</li><li>
Oh, with a dose of only
.1 microliters of Dendrotoxin.

</li><li>
I'm not Hermione. I can't create
instant paralysis with that.

</li><li>
You should have run the specs by me before
building the molds. The bullets are hollow.

</li><li>
It's a marvel I can keep them from breaking apart
in the chamber. Or used a higher-caliber round.

</li><li>
Or read a book. Have you
ever heard of physics or...

</li><li>
What's the other one?... Inertia?
It's not particularly difficult.

</li><li>
Fitz-Simmons?

</li><li>
Fitz.

</li><li>
Simmons.

</li><li>
I'm engineering.
She's biochem.

</li><li>
Agent Ward?

</li><li>
Coulson said I'd need
my comm receiver encoded.

</li><li>
Don't know if you've worked
with that model before.

</li><li>
It's...

</li><li>
Brand-new.

</li><li>
He'll repurpose
the I.D.I.S. chip.

</li><li>
Don't need the external receiver
for the inner-ear comms anymore.

</li><li>
So, uh, how does it...

</li><li>
Embedded sensorineural silicone
matched to your DNA.

</li><li>
It's very posh.

</li><li>
So, are you excited to be coming
on our journey into mystery?

</li><li>
It's like Christmas.

</li><li>
One of Coulson's
old S.H.I.E.L.D. collectibles.

</li><li>
Flamethrowers,
world's first GPS.

</li><li>
He's mad for this crap.

</li><li>
Don't touch Lola.

</li><li>
And he calls it
a girl's name.

</li><li>
Lola's not just a collectible,
you know.

</li><li>
People tend to confuse
the words "new" and "improved."

</li><li>
This mobile command,

</li><li>
They were in heavy rotation
back in the '90s,

</li><li>
but then
we got a heli-carrier.

</li><li>
Hey. Did you hear the one about
the guy who's afraid of flying?

</li><li>
I've done a night jump into a
drop zone under heavy fire, sir.

</li><li>
I can handle it.

</li><li>
That was a... joke.

</li><li>
The first part of a...

</li><li>
I'm not
gonna tell it now.

</li><li>
If you plan to unpack,
make it quick.

</li><li>
Wheels are up in five.

</li><li>
We may have a hit on one of
The Rising Tide's routing points.

</li><li>
Good. We need to do
some catching up.

</li><li>
Is that...
who I think it is?

</li><li>
She's just the pilot.

</li><li>
Melinda May
is "just the pilot."

</li><li>
Come on, sir.

</li><li>
What game
are you really playing?

</li><li>
Better stow your gear.

</li><li>
How will you come at us?

</li><li>
From the air?

</li><li>
From the ground?

</li><li>
How will you silence us
this time?

</li><li>
How can you?

</li><li>
The truth is in the wind.

</li><li>
It's everywhere.

</li><li>
You cannot stop The Rising Tide.

</li><li>
You will not find us.

</li><li>
You will never see our faces.

</li><li>
But rest assured...

</li><li>
We will rise against those
who shield us from the truth.

</li><li>
And nothing...
nothing can stop us in the...

</li><li>
Hey.

</li><li>
What up?

</li><li>
You guys are making
a big mistake.

</li><li>
You don't look that big.

</li><li>
Sorry
for the lack of finesse.

</li><li>
Agent Ward here has had a little
history with your group...

</li><li>
The Rising Tide.

</li><li>
I don't know...
what you're...

</li><li>
Okay, there are two ways
we can do this.

</li><li>
Oh. Is one of them
the easy way?

</li><li>
No.

</li><li>
Oh.

</li><li>
What's your name?

</li><li>
Skye.

</li><li>
What's your real name?

</li><li>
That can wait.

</li><li>
It's another name we need...
a certain hero.

</li><li>
What makes you think
I know that?

</li><li>
Well, you made
a little mistake.

</li><li>
The phone you filmed
the hooded hero with

</li><li>
had the same
cryptographic signature

</li><li>
as a few
of The Rising Tide posts.

</li><li>
Wow. Yeah.

</li><li>
Was that a mistake?

</li><li>
Or am I now sitting

</li><li>
in the center
of your secret headquarters?

</li><li>
What is this?

</li><li>
A plane?

</li><li>
I got inside.

</li><li>
And by now,
you've discovered

</li><li>
you can't beat the encryption
on my equipment,

</li><li>
so you got nothing.

</li><li>
We have a fairly strong
coincidence...

</li><li>
you being on the scene

</li><li>
right before
it went up in flames.

</li><li>
Want to tell me
what my team is gonna find out?

</li><li>
How did you know the hooded man
was in the building?

</li><li>
Did you blow it up
to draw him out?

</li><li>
Did you?

</li><li>
That's not our style.

</li><li>
I was just kidnapped
by your "style."

</li><li>
S.H.I.E.L.D. covered up
New Mexico, Project Pegasus.

</li><li>
Of course you'd be
covering up Centipede.

</li><li>
Holy no way.

</li><li>
You don't know
what that is.

</li><li>
Billions of dollars of equipment
at your disposal,

</li><li>
And I beat you with a laptop
that I won in a bet?

</li><li>
You need to think
about your friend.

</li><li>
We're not the only ones
interested

</li><li>
in people with powers.

</li><li>
We'd like to contain him,
yeah.

</li><li>
The next guy
will want to exploit him,

</li><li>
and the guy after that
will want to dissect him.

</li><li>
What is Centipede?

</li><li>
Yeah, I get it, but...

</li><li>
listen, doctor, people saw me.
They saw what I can do.

</li><li>
If I went public,
that might be good.

</li><li>
I mean, your product works.

</li><li>
It works amazingly, and...

</li><li>
yeah, yeah,
I-I-I know what I signed,

</li><li>
but if we got out
in front of this, maybe...

</li><li>
Then what?

</li><li>
You want me to go crawling back
to the factory?

</li><li>
I couldn't even get workmen's
comp from those crooks.

</li><li>
I don't think...

</li><li>
Yeah, ye...

</li><li>
Doctor, I just thought...

</li><li>
Okay.

</li><li>
This was a lab.

</li><li>
Was this leased
as a lab?

</li><li>
Mnh-mnh.
Self-empowerment center.

</li><li>
With a top-of-the-line
motion-sensor security system.

</li><li>
Ah.
So a secret lab.

</li><li>
And a superhero.

</li><li>
Not a coincidence.

</li><li>
So, was this explosion sabotage?
Was it meant for him?

</li><li>
Or were they just
in over their heads?

</li><li>
Yeah,
working the problem.

</li><li>
Ladies, if you'll just...

</li><li>
Sorry.

</li><li>
If you're gonna be in the field,
agent Fitz,

</li><li>
you have to
get your hands dirty.

</li><li>
No, I don't.

</li><li>
♪ Heigh-ho,
off to work you go ♪

</li><li>
Centipede...
it was chatter on the web

</li><li>
and then gone.

</li><li>
I traced the access-point
MAC address to that building.

</li><li>
What were you after?

</li><li>
The truth.

</li><li>
What are you after?

</li><li>
World peace.

</li><li>
You pseudo-anarchist hacker
types love to stir things up.

</li><li>
But you're never around
for the fallout.

</li><li>
People keep secrets
for a reason, Skye.

</li><li>
Well, just because
you're reasonable and...

</li><li>
firm...

</li><li>
doesn't mean that you're not
an evil, faceless

</li><li>
government tool bag.

</li><li>
Just give us
your guy's name.

</li><li>
He's not my guy!

</li><li>
You understand
he's in danger.

</li><li>
Then let me go.

</li><li>
Let me talk to him.
Me, not the T-1000 here.

</li><li>
You want to be alone with him.
Of course.

</li><li>
She's a groupie.

</li><li>
All this hacking into
S.H.I.E.L.D., tracking powers...

</li><li>
she might as well be one
of those sweaty cosplay girls

</li><li>
crowding around
Stark Tower.

</li><li>
What?! I would...

</li><li>
It was one time.

</li><li>
Ward.

</li><li>
Is it the girl?
She getting under your skin?

</li><li>
Sir?

</li><li>
Or is it
the assignment?

</li><li>
Are you so anxious
to get out of this

</li><li>
that you'd deliberately
blow an interrogation?

</li><li>
Give me a minute alone
with her, you'll have your answers.

</li><li>
She's an asset.

</li><li>
She is such an a...

</li><li>
Wait... "asset"?

</li><li>
We don't know anything
about her.

</li><li>
Do you appreciate
how often that happens?

</li><li>
That never happens.

</li><li>
We need...

</li><li>
what she knows.

</li><li>
See, we designed each
with their own capabilities,

</li><li>
so, um, some recording

</li><li>
the dimensions and textures
of the room,

</li><li>
and then some testing
the matter density, radiation.

</li><li>
I mean, one is basically
just smelling.

</li><li>
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
I've got something in something.

</li><li>
Who's got it?

</li><li>
Uh... Bashful.

</li><li>
Aww.

</li><li>
Surveillance camera.
Deep-fried.

</li><li>
Yes, but that model

</li><li>
Has flash memory in case of brownouts.

</li><li>
Now, I could sync that with data
from the motion detectors

</li><li>
and, with a little luck,

</li><li>
get some images
from before the blast.

</li><li>
And by "luck," I mean
"unappreciated genius."

</li><li>
Yeah, we'll need it.

</li><li>
Snow's reading some compounds
that are...

</li><li>
Whoa. My god.

</li><li>
Explosive?

</li><li>
Not of this earth.

</li><li>
This is QNB-T16.

</li><li>
It's the top-shelf Martini
of Sodium Pentothal derivatives.

</li><li>
It's a brand-new
and extremely potent truth drug.

</li><li>
Don't worry. The effects
only last about an hour.

</li><li>
And you'll have
a nice little nap.

</li><li>
And we'll have
all the answers to our...

</li><li>
Hey!
What the hell?!

</li><li>
I'm sorry.
Did that hurt?

</li><li>
No.

</li><li>
But you've lost
your mind.

</li><li>
You should never do that
to a member of your team.

</li><li>
And, yes,
it did hurt a little bit.

</li><li>
But I always try and mask my
pain in front of beautiful women

</li><li>
'cause I think it makes me
seem more masculine.

</li><li>
My god,
this stuff works fast.

</li><li>
Don't trust us?

</li><li>
Ask him
whatever you'd like.

</li><li>
Wait a minute.

</li><li>
Wait. You can't just...

</li><li>
this is definitely
not protoco...

</li><li>
You seem nervous,
Agent Ward.

</li><li>
I'm calling to mind
my training.

</li><li>
There's no way I'm gonna reveal
classified secrets

</li><li>
to a girl who's hell-bent
on taking us down.

</li><li>
Have you ever
killed anyone?

</li><li>
Yes, a few.

</li><li>
High-risk targets.

</li><li>
But they were
terrible people...

</li><li>
Who were trying
to murder nice people.

</li><li>
And I didn't feel good
afterwards.

</li><li>
And does your grandmother
know about these things?

</li><li>
Gramzy?

</li><li>
My hands are tied, Mike. It's company policy.

</li><li>
You didn't meet quota.
I had to let you go.

</li><li>
Gary, look, I got no choice.
It's just me and my boy now.

</li><li>
There's no openings, Mike,
and even if there were,

</li><li>
I got a hundred guys standing
in line that are just like you,

</li><li>
only they won't bitch
when their back hurts.

</li><li>
I was injured,
but I'm stronger now.

</li><li>
I can handle
twice the load I used to.

</li><li>
What are you not hearing?

</li><li>
You don't cut it.

</li><li>
When I say I need things moved,
I need...

</li><li>
Oh, hey! Hey!

</li><li>
Like that?

</li><li>
Are you
out of your mind?!

</li><li>
Ohh!

</li><li>
Heads up!

</li><li>
These are people, Gary.

</li><li>
Men!

</li><li>
Not parts you replace
when they break.

</li><li>
It's not me, man.
It's the company.

</li><li>
I'm not the bad guy.

</li><li>
I'm not the bad guy,
man.

</li><li>
Yes, you are.

</li><li>
It's simple now,
just like we used to read about.

</li><li>
You're the bad guy.

</li><li>
And I'm the hero.

</li><li>
Did agent Ward
give you anything?

</li><li>
He told me he's been to Paris,
but he's never really seen it

</li><li>
And that he wishes
you had stayed in Tahiti.

</li><li>
It's a magical place.

</li><li>
Ward doesn't like
your style.

</li><li>
Kind of think I do.

</li><li>
What about his?

</li><li>
Remains
in critical condition.

</li><li>
Employees could not identify
the attacker,

</li><li>
but security footage confirms

</li><li>
that this man assaulted
the factory foreman

</li><li>
before damaging
thousands of dollars' worth

</li><li>
of company property.
This is wrong.

</li><li>
This is not... the guy I met.
He was...

</li><li>
With us here on KZQM25.

</li><li>
He just needs a break.

</li><li>
Then give him one.

</li><li>
What have you got?

</li><li>
Michael Peterson...

</li><li>
factory worker,
married, one kid.

</li><li>
Gets injured, gets laid off.
Wife jumps ship.

</li><li>
Good guy, bad breaks.

</li><li>
Best guess is,
somebody tells him

</li><li>
they can make him strong again,
make him super.

</li><li>
Who has the tech
to do that?

</li><li>
And why would they
want to?

</li><li>
Fitz, what do we have
from the security footage

</li><li>
before the blast?

</li><li>
What are we seeing?

</li><li>
Well, the man is angry
at the other man.

</li><li>
The data
is very corrupt.

</li><li>
Yeah, like cold war Russia corrupt.
Yeah.

</li><li>
I-I can't sync the timecode
without...

</li><li>
What if
you had the audio?

</li><li>
I was... running surveillance
on the lab.

</li><li>
I had my shotgun mic pointed at
the window before the blast.

</li><li>
The digital file's
in my van.

</li><li>
There's too much
background noise for me,

</li><li>
But you could probably... 
You can clean that up, can't you?

</li><li>
Find a sync point and use
cross-field validation

</li><li>
to find... 
But I can't scrub for expression patterns

</li><li>
when the vit-c is all... 
Well, is there a chrominance subcarrier?

</li><li>
Yeah, attached to the back porch. 
Brilliant.

</li><li>
Um, that audio would be great. Thank you very, very much.
We will take that audio, please.

</li><li>
Your van's here,
but you were right...

</li><li>
We couldn't decrypt
the files.

</li><li>
The encryption's
coupled to the GPS.

</li><li>
Get my van back to that alley,
and then I'm in business.

</li><li>
Agent May will escort you.

</li><li>
And on your way out,
wake up Ward.

</li><li>
Volunteer
services to Oncology 1.

</li><li>
Volunteer services
to Oncology 1.

</li><li>
You're...

</li><li>
Oh, wow.
You're... him.

</li><li>
I'm glad
you're doing okay.

</li><li>
Oh, yeah.

</li><li>
Thank you.
They're beautiful.

</li><li>
What the hell
are you doing here?

</li><li>
I don't know where to go,
doctor.

</li><li>
Everything's getting...

</li><li>
I-I know what's right.
I do.

</li><li>
But no one
will listen to me.

</li><li>
I volunteered because
you said things would change.

</li><li>
And... you said
you could keep it together.

</li><li>
Our first subject
lost it...

</li><li>
walked into the lab
with a fricking bomb.

</li><li>
I'm not like him.

</li><li>
Well, tell that to your foreman
in the I.C.U.

</li><li>
I saved you.

</li><li>
You exposed me!

</li><li>
You exposed the program.

</li><li>
The people
who gave me this technology...

</li><li>
they are very serious,

</li><li>
and they do not
want to be revealed.

</li><li>
Mike Peterson
needs to disappear.

</li><li>
You're right.

</li><li>
I'm not him anymore.

</li><li>
I'm someone else now.

</li><li>
Oh, please.

</li><li>
You're juiced, Mike.

</li><li>
And you're losing it,
just like the last guy.

</li><li>
This is a disaster.

</li><li>
No.

</li><li>
It's an origin story.

</li><li>
Audio file
should be coming through.

</li><li>
It's not compressed,
so it might take a minute.

</li><li>
Uh, yeah.

</li><li>
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
I'm getting it.

</li><li>
So, uh, uh,
when... when you get back,

</li><li>
I'll show you my thing.

</li><li>
A thing. It's not...
I-it's my hardware.

</li><li>
My equipment.

</li><li>
Let's... hang up.

</li><li>
So, the alien metal
wasn't the explosive?

</li><li>
Well, I assumed
from the break pattern

</li><li>
and dispersion
that it was,

</li><li>
but it's just dripping
with gamma radiation and...

</li><li>
Oh!

</li><li>
Now it's actually dripping.

</li><li>
Fun.

</li><li>
So, what did that get us?

</li><li>
Skye's sending us the rest of her
decrypted files on Centipede.

</li><li>
But we have her audio.
I've loaded it up.

</li><li>
Nice work.

</li><li>
Now,
using motion estimation,

</li><li>
Bayesian inference,
a beam splitter,

</li><li>
and a little
diffraction theory,

</li><li>
our mystery man...

</li><li>
appears.

</li><li>
It's like magic.

</li><li>
But it's... it's science.

</li><li>
Explosives in the case?

</li><li>
To please calm down.
Just let me check your vitals.

</li><li>
I feel fine.
I want to feel more.

</li><li>
Where's the doctor?
Where is she?!

</li><li>
I-if you don't settle down,
I-I'll have you sedated.

</li><li>
Where is she?!

</li><li>
Wait. Did you...
did you see that on his arm?

</li><li>
What does that
look like to you?

</li><li>
A centipede.

</li><li>
It's an intravenous filter
for his blood.

</li><li>
This goo, sir...
very similar to the serum

</li><li>
Dr. Erskine developed
in the '40s for the...

</li><li>
Super soldiers.

</li><li>
I'm reading alien metal,
gamma radiation, the serum...

</li><li>
every known source of superpower
thrown in a blender.

</li><li>
We need to see
the origin of the blast.

</li><li>
Run it back
from the last point recorded.

</li><li>
That should do it.

</li><li>
Let's head back.

</li><li>
All right, let me
just...

</li><li>
Mike.

</li><li>
What are you doing?
Saving you.

</li><li>
From the scary men
in dark suits.

</li><li>
- And you're gonna help save us.
- "Us"?

</li><li>
Don't cry.

</li><li>
Okay?
Stay strong for me, Ace.

</li><li>
What are we?
We're a team.

</li><li>
That's right.

</li><li>
Now drive.

</li><li>
Extremis.

</li><li>
It's new.

</li><li>
Completely unstable.

</li><li>
Poor man
didn't bring an explosive.

</li><li>
And Mike has the same stuff
in his system.

</li><li>
And judging by
his strength level, a lot more.

</li><li>
So any minute now,
Mike is gonna...

</li><li>
He'll take out anyone
within a two-block radius.

</li><li>
Well...

</li><li>
You wanted a bomb.

</li><li>
Sir?

</li><li>
He didn't explode
because he was angry.

</li><li>
The two are connected.

</li><li>
It... it's kind of
a chemical surge.

</li><li>
But calming him down
will buy him a minute at most.

</li><li>
He will detonate
within the next few hours.

</li><li>
Solution?

</li><li>
Isolate him,
get him away from people.

</li><li>
Or?

</li><li>
Put a bullet
through his brain.

</li><li>
If he's dead, this irradiated
metabolic process will stop.

</li><li>
We need to come up with
a third option...

</li><li>
one that doesn't involve
Mike's son losing a father.

</li><li>
We have a couple of hours
at most.

</li><li>
There's no way
that we could possibly...

</li><li>
Don't ever tell me
there's no way!

</li><li>
It's on you.

</li><li>
Get it done.

</li><li>
May?

</li><li>
He took Skye.

</li><li>
You all right?

</li><li>
We'll deal with that later...
at length.

</li><li>
Right now, we need to figure out
where they went.

</li><li>
How long
is this gonna take?

</li><li>
This is top speed.
Trust me.

</li><li>
It's not like
I'm deleting a Facebook page.

</li><li>
I'm bypassing
the license bureau's

</li><li>
A.E.S.-protected
data stream.

</li><li>
So chill.

</li><li>
How do I know
you can really do this?

</li><li>
I've done it before.

</li><li>
Come on.
Give me more paralysis.

</li><li>
Less rigor mortis!

</li><li>
Oh, come on!

</li><li>
No, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no, no.

</li><li>
Just pretend
it's an exam.

</li><li>
We're taking an exam.

</li><li>
An exam... yeah.

</li><li>
Yeah.
Okay.

</li><li>
I don't want an "F."

</li><li>
"F" equals a massacre.

</li><li>
Whoa.

</li><li>
Oh, no!

</li><li>
What is this nonsense?

</li><li>
Why are you making nonsense?!
This isn't me!

</li><li>
It's noise. Someone's hacking
our secure channel.

</li><li>
It's longitude
and latitude.

</li><li>
Mike took Skye.

</li><li>
She's telling us where.

</li><li>
We'll take the nice lady
with us.

</li><li>
We... we... we can't go
to the airport,

</li><li>
So we'll...
we'll take a train.

</li><li>
And there, she'll...
she'll help us start over,

</li><li>
Make a new life...

</li><li>
A better life,
like I always said.

</li><li>
Look at this place.

</li><li>
You're gonna risk thousands
of lives over some nobody.

</li><li>
Nobody's nobody, Ward.

</li><li>
Fitz-Simmons
will come through.

</li><li>
Mr. Peterson, 
good morning.

</li><li>
We're not a threat.
We're here to help.

</li><li>
But you're in danger,
and we need to take you in.

</li><li>
What did you do?!

</li><li>
Whoa! Get down!

</li><li>
Come on.

</li><li>
Come on.

</li><li>
Please return
to check-in counter.

</li><li>
Yeah, we won't.

</li><li>
You're right...
he is a little bitch.

</li><li>
Yo, get him! Get him!

</li><li>
Ace, get back!

</li><li>
Get out the way, man!
Come on! Come on, now!

</li><li>
Aah!

</li><li>
Ace!

</li><li>
Tell dispatch we'll need backup!

</li><li>
I don't know. Just go.

</li><li>
Just keep going
to the other side.

</li><li>
You need to get inside.

</li><li>
Hey.
Let's get him out of here.

</li><li>
I want my daddy.
I promise.

</li><li>
Come on, honey.
Ace!

</li><li>
Ace! Ohh!

</li><li>
Look... the stuff inside you
is unstable.

</li><li>
It'll kill you
and everyone in here.

</li><li>
Who's gonna miss us?!

</li><li>
Come on! Get inside!

</li><li>
We're at the north entrance,
May.

</li><li>
You told them
to hold fire.

</li><li>
I don't think that's us.

</li><li>
We may have
a third party here.

</li><li>
He's gonna head down
to the tracks.

</li><li>
You stay high.
I'll go low.

</li><li>
Only take the shot
if you have to, Ward.

</li><li>
Ward!

</li><li>
If I have to.

</li><li>
You got to stop!

</li><li>
These people
can help you.

</li><li>
The men in suits?
They're your buddies now?

</li><li>
Where did they take
my son?!

</li><li>
Get down!

</li><li>
Ohh!

</li><li>
Think
that means anything?

</li><li>
I know you got men everywhere
waiting to put me down.

</li><li>
I know
how this plays out.

</li><li>
I don't.

</li><li>
I know you got poison
in your system.

</li><li>
I know
it's burning you up.

</li><li>
Mike, the last guy
who wore that exploded.

</li><li>
I'm not like that other guy.
I'm...

</li><li>
It matters who I am...
inside, if I'm a good person,

</li><li>
If I'm strong.

</li><li>
I have a clear shot.

</li><li>
Do you copy?

</li><li>
I know you're strong.

</li><li>
Your boy knows it.

</li><li>
He needs you
to let us help.

</li><li>
You took him!

</li><li>
You took
my wife, my job, my house.

</li><li>
You think
this is killing me?!

</li><li>
All over, there's people
being pushed down, being robbed.

</li><li>
One of them
tries to stand up,

</li><li>
you got to make an example
out of him.

</li><li>
You bring this building down
on us, will that help them?

</li><li>
That's a lie!

</li><li>
All you do is lie!

</li><li>
You said
if we worked hard...

</li><li>
If we did right...

</li><li>
we'd have a place.

</li><li>
You said it was enough
to be a man.

</li><li>
But there's better
than man.

</li><li>
There's gods.

</li><li>
And the rest of us...

</li><li>
What are we?

</li><li>
They're giants.

</li><li>
We're what they step on.

</li><li>
I know.

</li><li>
I've seen giants...
up close.

</li><li>
And that privilege
cost me...

</li><li>
nearly everything.

</li><li>
But the good ones...

</li><li>
the real deal...

</li><li>
they're not heroes because of
what they have that we don't.

</li><li>
It's what they do
with it.

</li><li>
You're right, Mike.

</li><li>
It matters who you are.

</li><li>
I could, you know?

</li><li>
Be a hero.

</li><li>
I'm counting on it.

</li><li>
Subject is in stable condition.

</li><li>
All clear at Union Station.

</li><li>
Come on.

</li><li>
Hey.

</li><li>
Come on.

</li><li>
I told him
his father was coming home.

</li><li>
He will.

</li><li>
We have some experience
with this.

</li><li>
He almost blew.

</li><li>
We almost died.

</li><li>
We have some experience
with that, too.

</li><li>
Don't have it all
mapped out.

</li><li>
True.

</li><li>
We didn't cut off
the head of the Centipede.

</li><li>
Whoever sponsored that little
experiment is still out there,

</li><li>
Among other things.

</li><li>
It's a brave new world.

</li><li>
And a really old car.

</li><li>
Lola can keep up.

</li><li>
What about you?

</li><li>
Have you thought
about the offer?

</li><li>
Hitching a ride
on the crazy plane?

</li><li>
I'm not exactly
a team player.

</li><li>
We're not exactly
a team.

</li><li>
But we're in a position
to do some good.

</li><li>
You'd be a great help.

</li><li>
And you'd be front row center
at the strangest show on earth,

</li><li>
Which is, after all,
what you wanted.

</li><li>
I was able to hack S.H.I.E.L.D.
from my van.

</li><li>
You're gonna show me
something new?

</li><li>
Go.

</li><li>
Sir, we've got an 0-8-4.

</li><li>
Is that confirmed?

</li><li>
They want us to go in
and confirm it.

</li><li>
What's an 0-8-4?

</li><li>
You've got
exactly 10 minutes

</li><li>
to decide
if you really want to know.

</li><li>
There's no way we can make it
to the airfield in...

</li><li>
10 minutes.

</li><li>
The tide is rising.
</li>
